# Ryter - A productivity app for writers.

Hi everyone! This project is an amalgamation of several others I've been working on locally and I think could be really useful for writing.
It has 5 apps on different pages:

### Home
The first page you land on when you click on a link to the site. Navigate to other pages by clicking on the black and white hamburger icon in the top right hand corner.
### Notes
Pretty straightforward to use:
1. Click on the big "+" button
1. Fill in the title and content
1. Hit return
### To-do List
Similarly easy to use:
1. Type in your task
1. Hit return, your task will appear in both "All" and "Pending" filters
1. Once your done, click on your task and it'll be marked as "Completed"
### Speech-To-Text (STT)
+ Just as the name implies, it converts your speech to text. 
+ It might ask for permission to use your microphone, click "Allow" and start talking.
+ The page where the text appears is contenteditable; you can can click on it and make edits to the text.
### Pomodoro Timer
Here's some [information](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique) about the Pomodoro technique. To use the timer, save your preferred focus and break time before clicking the start button.
### Fantasia
Click on the icons and watch the page change colors!
